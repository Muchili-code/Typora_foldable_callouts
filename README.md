# Typora_foldable_callouts
> [!note]
> This is my personal addition to typora personal callouts,which supports the callouts in typora to fold, like the obsidian.


## Q&A
**Is my version of Typora supported?**
Typora's version should be ≥ 0.9.98 (the last free version).

## How to Use:
For technical reasons, now it is only developed in Windows platform.

## Using method
First, download the corresponding plugin according to the tutorial. Locate the `./resources/plugin/custom/plugins` directory where the downloaded plugin is located, and replace the entire content of `callout.js` with the content of `callouts.js` from the release.

Then, enable the plugin's callout function support (supported by default upon download).

Optional: Disable Typora's default callout support.
